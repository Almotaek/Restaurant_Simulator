PROJECT TITLE: Restaurant Simulation
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:Run the program by making a new object of the simulation class. This will require you to input the number of cashiers and the type of data structure that you want to use. For the type of data structures, add 0 or 1.

Successful economic activities are one of the results of great economic modeling. In the age of “Big-data”, data-driven companies like Google and Netflix are shaping their models based on information from their massive databases. However, how can you make a great economic model without being a tech giant? An interesting yet cheap alternative to large databases is simulations. Simulations allow us to make models, expect results, test hypotheses, and understand systems without real-life data. This project will explore the power of simulations using the right data structures.  The aim is to build a restaurant simulation that allows us to optimize profit and minimize overflow and customer waiting time using data structures learned in CS150. Additionally, this work will compare LinkedList and ArrayDeque.
